# LoTron2
Feature updates for LanceOtron 2

**LanceOtron** is a machine learning, genomic data extraction and analysis tool trained for ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and DNase-seq peak calling. A freely available and fully-featured webtool version, utilising the graphical user interface [MLV](https://mlv.molbiol.ox.ac.uk) and hosted at the [MRC WIMM Centre of Computational Biology, University of Oxford](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/research/units-and-centres/mrc-wimm-centre-for-computational-biology), can be found at [LanceOtron.molbiol.ox.ac.uk](https://lanceotron.molbiol.ox.ac.uk).
